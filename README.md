# Selenium Automatization
This is a Laboratory of the Cryptography course at Universidad Diego portales that has the objective of learn about the security in different websites in different locations of the work. Here I audited the Chilean website [Solotodo](https://www.solotodo.cl/) and the Spanish website [https://www.pccomponentes.com/](Pccomponentes).
## Prerequisite
These are the prerequisites that you need to have installed in order of the automation to work.
- Python 3
- Selenium
- Google Chrome browser
- Chromedriver with the same version as Google Chrome

### Chromedriver
[Here is](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) the Chromedriver's getting-started page where you can download the version that suits you.
